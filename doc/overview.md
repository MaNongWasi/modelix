# Modelix Overview

This document contains some information about the internals of Modelix.

A Modelix server constitutes a "CloudRepository". Each "CloudRepository" can contains a number of trees. We can regard effectively each tree to be fully independent. In a way a Tree in Modelix is equivalent to a git repository.
