Feature: Storing routes
  We verify the core storing routes work

#  Scenario: A token can be generated
#    Given the server has been started with in-memory storage
#    When I visit "/generateToken"
#    Then I should get an OK response
#     And the text of the page should be 32 characters long
#     And the text of the page contains only hexadecimal digits
